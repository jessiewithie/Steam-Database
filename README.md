# CIS550-FINAL-PROJ

Recently gaming has become more popular as more people choose to become professional E-sport players and more people are able to pick up electronic devices, from phones/laptops to x-box and Nintendo switches. Yet with the uprising of the gaming industry, there are a lot options. As a result, the customers easily spend a lot of time trying out random games yet still not finding a game that they like. This is how the steam-database came into play. By allowing the users to searching up for specific games and filtering specific genres, we will provide the most helpful reviews and relevant game info like trailers, pictures, and tags to help the user find their next favorite game!

In this project, we used AngularJS as our basic frame work and a variety of tools including AngularJS(including Promise), Boot- strap, HTML 5, CSS/BOOTSTRAP, JS, JSON, JQuery, and a few APIs for the UI.(including the API to retrieve image and video from STEAM) We used Express and NodeJS for the server side function and OracleDB(hosted on AWS), MongoDB for the database. We used npm as the building tool and angular controller to control the DOM.

Our raw dataset was taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/trolukovich/steam-games-complete-dataset. We also used https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ as the proxy to access https://store.steampowered.com/, which was the api that provided real time image and videos for the detail page.
